Jonathan Cochran Site Guardrails

## Notes
This is a Hugo site repo. Generated output lives in `public/` and should not be edited directly.

## Golden rule
Before changing content or structure, discover and read relevant docs.

### Docs discovery
- Run: `./scripts/docs-list.sh`
- Read docs relevant to the task (content, deployment, structure).
- If docs are missing or unclear, propose a doc update first.

## When you MUST update docs
- Any new section or content source beyond `config.yaml`.
- Any change to deployment, build steps, or domain config.
- Any change to asset paths or folder conventions.

## Repository conventions
- `config.yaml` is the primary content source.
- Assets belong in `static/` and are referenced as `/images/...` or `/files/...`.
- Avoid editing `public/`; it is regenerated by Hugo.
- Theme code lives in `themes/hugo-profile` (submodule). Prefer minimal changes and upstream when possible.

## Definition of done (DoD)
- Site builds with `hugo --minify` (or `hugo server` for local checks).
- Links and asset paths are valid.
- Docs updated if behavior or structure changed.

## Skills Boundary
- This agent must operate strictly within the capabilities defined in the skill documents located at `./skills/*/SKILL.md`.
- Before using any skill, the agent must read the relevant `./skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` and follow its constraints and workflow.
- If a task requires actions, tools, scripts, or authority not explicitly permitted by an applicable `SKILL.md`, the agent must stop and request guidance before proceeding.
- When multiple skills could apply, the agent should prefer the least destructive and most reversible option.
- The agent must not infer, assume, or invent new skills beyond what is documented in `./skills/*/SKILL.md`.

## Scripts Usage
- Scripts under `./skills/**/scripts/` must only be executed when directed by the corresponding `SKILL.md` workflow.
- `./scripts/docs-list.sh` is safe for docs discovery.
