# Project Overview

## What This Repo Is
A Hugo-based personal portfolio site using the `hugo-profile` theme. Content is primarily configured in `config.yaml`, with images and files in `static/`.

## Key Paths
- `config.yaml`: primary source of truth for site content and layout.
- `static/`: images, icons, and files served at root paths.
- `archetypes/`: default content archetypes (currently minimal).
- `themes/hugo-profile`: theme submodule (vendor code).
- `public/`: generated output from Hugo builds (do not hand-edit).
- `.github/workflows/deploy_gh_pages.yaml`: GitHub Pages deployment workflow.
- `notes/`: non-source artifacts or backups that should not be treated as active config.

## Core Conventions
- Treat `config.yaml` as the canonical content document.
- Keep assets in `static/` and reference them with `/`-prefixed paths.
- Avoid editing `public/` directly; it is regenerated by Hugo.
- Theme changes should be made in `themes/hugo-profile` only when necessary, and ideally upstreamed.
