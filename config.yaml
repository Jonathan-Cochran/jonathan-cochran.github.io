    title: "About Me"

    content: |-
      I’m a technology and innovation leader based in Columbus, OH, currently working at Nationwide Insurance, where I focus on solving real problems for insurance agents through thoughtful application of technology, AI, and design thinking. My work lives at the intersection of human needs and technical possibility—helping translate messy, real-world challenges into practical, scalable solutions.

      With a background in computer science and mathematics, I’ve spent my career operating where strategy meets execution: building, guiding, and refining initiatives that blend AI, design thinking, lean principles, and agile delivery. I’m particularly interested in how emerging technologies can reduce friction, amplify human judgment, and create better experiences—not just shinier tools.

      Outside of work, I enjoy time with my family, being outdoors, and running. “Enjoy” might be generous. I do run.

      **Principles I Lead With:**
      - Career Development: Demonstrate a commitment to each team member's growth, not just project objectives.
      - Transparency with Stakeholders: Maintain open communication and proactively share updates to remove surprises.
